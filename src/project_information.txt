FILES INCLUDED IN THE PROJECT TREE:

system.h - Defines oscillator parameters, system functions (i.e. system_reset(),
system.c   high_priority_enter(), close_handle(), garbage_collect_do(), etc) and
           in fact should be included in every source file.
           NOTE: Before using, call system_init(), but ensure it is called
                 EXACTLY once.

configuration_bits.c - Contains device configuration bit macros.  Refer to
    the comments in configuration_bits.c for instructions on where to get
    information about device configuration bits and their corresponding macros.

interrupts.c - This file contains example stubs for interrupts.

main.c - Entry point is located here

traps.c - Generally speaking, a user would not modify this file unless
    they were having problems resulting in traps.  If the code in this file
    is entered, that means there is a critical hardware problem or software bug.
    The trap will need evaluated by the user to determine the source
    of the problem.  www.microchip.com/codeexamples contains trap example code
    which can be used as a reference to help debug traps.

oscillators.h - Functions for safe and easy oscillator switching. Before use
oscillators.c   shall be initialized with osc_init()

uart_base.h - Functions for easy and stable UART communication. Before use shall
uart_base.c   be initialized with uart_init().

wdt.h - Functions to use with watch-dog functionality
wdt.c

messaging.h - Functions for multi-master communication with time synchronisation
messaging.c
